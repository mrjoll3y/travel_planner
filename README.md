# Overview

I created this travel planner app to help people organize their trips, including adding destinations, activities, dates, budget, and hotels. The app is simple to use, allowing users to input their trip details in different categories and keep everything in one place. It’s designed to make trip planning less stressful and more organized. My goal was to practice building mobile apps with Flutter and Dart while creating something practical.

**How to use the app:**
- Start by entering your trip destination.
- Add the trip dates, activities you plan to do, where you'll be staying, and your budget.
- You can keep adding multiple trips, and the app saves them in a list format that you can check anytime.
- You can easily see all the details in one place to help you stay organized.

**Purpose for creating this app:**
I built this app because I wanted to get better at mobile development and work with Flutter, which is a framework I’ve been learning. I also thought a travel planner would be a cool and useful project since it’s something people use, and I could practice managing different types of data and building an interactive UI. This project helped me learn a lot about app structure, state management, and how to create something practical.

# Development Environment

- **Flutter**: The framework I used to build the app.
- **Dart**: The programming language for the app’s code.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My editor for writing and managing the code.
- **Flutter SDK**: The set of tools that make Flutter apps work.
- **Material Design Widgets**: I used these to design the app's UI.

The app uses Flutter's StatefulWidget to update the screen when the user adds new trip information. This lets the app be dynamic and respond to user input in real-time.

# Useful Websites

Here are a few websites that helped me out a lot during development:

* [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) – This is the official documentation that explains how to use all of Flutter's features.
* [Dart Programming Language](https://dart.dev) – The official Dart site for learning the language.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) – When I hit issues, this is where I went for answers.
* [Flutter YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FlutterDev) – Lots of helpful videos for learning Flutter.

# Future Work

There’s still a lot I could do to improve and add to this app. Here’s what I’m thinking would help:

* **Layout** - Make the application visually appealing.
* **User Accounts** – Adding the ability for users to create accounts and save their trips online.
* **Calendar view** – Making it so users can see updates in a calender.
* **Expense Tracking** – Helping users keep track of their budget and actual expenses while traveling.
